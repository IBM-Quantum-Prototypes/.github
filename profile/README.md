# Quantum Prototypes

_Quantum Prototypes_ are Qiskit-compatible software packages based on quantum algorithms and applications developed at IBM Quantum. They are made available to you during the development phase to give you early access to cutting-edge research.

Quantum prototypes offer the opportunity to interact with the codebase as a researcher or developer and engage with other users. If you would like to share your feedback, you can

- Open an issue on the repository
- Start a conversation on the GitHub Discussions board within the repository
